## What does the AI Alliance offer? {itemprop=name}
{{% faq-answer %}}
Although we can implement ML solutions, that's not our core activity. 
The AI Alliance is all about putting in place the processes that ensure successful project delivery.
This can be in the form of corporate education or more conventional consulting - that is, identifying pain points. 
Teach a man to fish etc, etc.

## How do I know these processes will work for me? {itemprop=name}
{{% faq-answer %}}
Since data science is a relatively new discipline, it does not yet have the guard rails to ensure sucessful delivery. 
The AI Alliance transposes the best practices from adjacent disciplines and brings them to machine learning projects.
That is, we leverage decades of experience in the software engineering world and apply what we have seen work there to ML projects.
After all, if your ML projects involve code, you're software engineering by definition.
