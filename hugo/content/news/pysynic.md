We release [PySynic](https://pypi.org/project/pysynic/) to PyPI to facilitate the use of synthetic data that can be used to test ML pipelines.

Testing ML pipelines is still an immature discipline. We're bring testing best practices to ML with a lightweight framework that helps generated synthetic data. Synthetic data is GDPR friendly and can be run in any environment. With this data, ML practitioners can write robust tests.
