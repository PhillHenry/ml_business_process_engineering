## NHS/CF

We reduced time to market, increased model reliability and built a process that easily managed changing requirements mid project.

We did this by teaching best practices to two data scientists with PhDs in STEM subjects. 

The model was delivered on time and on budget.

Since it came with a robust suite of automated tests, production issues were easily dealt with after sign-off.

The project was so successful, it was a finalist in the [Best Healthcare Analytics Project for the NHS](https://www.hsj.co.uk/partnership-awards/hsj-partnership-awards-2023-best-healthcare-analytics-project-for-the-nhs/7034370.article).

A video of Dr Chris Monit and Phillip Henry discussing their experience at the London MLOps meetup can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gkITkmMx3Y#t=5m13s).


## HSBC

We introduced human readable tests that gave the business clear visibility into what was being built on a real time basis.

By leveraging our synthetic data processes, the business could change their mind on what they wanted at any point and the product would quickly change direction with them.

We won Connectionsâ€™ [Most Valuable Agile Project](https://www.101ways.com/uk-agile-awards-2010-and-the-nominations-are/),
