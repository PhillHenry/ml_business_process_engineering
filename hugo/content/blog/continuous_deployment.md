The Spitfire was the most awesome interceptor of the Second World War. 
<br/>
<br/>
Captured German airmen would routinely lie that they were shot down by a Spitfire rather than any other plane as there was no shame in losing to such a formidable foe. 
<br/>
<br/>
When Field Marshal Hermann GÃ¶ring asked a Luftwaffe general what he could do to help in his battle with the Bitish, the general bitingly replied that he'd like a squadron of their Spitfires.
<br/>
<br/>
And yet the Spitfire did not enter service fully formed. It underwent a process of continual improvement. By the end of the war, it was for example over 130km/h faster than its earlier versions.
<br/>
<br/>
This illustrates that contrary to popular opinion, engineering is generally a gradual process. 
<br/>
<br/>
And this is just as true for data science which is underpinned by data engineering. Models need constant tuning. In the case of an anti-fraud model that I saw one bank deploy, the model would degrade within weeks as the scammers quickly realised what no longer worked and moved quickly on to the next trick.
