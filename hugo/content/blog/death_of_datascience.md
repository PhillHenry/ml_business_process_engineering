I know the title is clickbait. And I know it's subject to [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) ("Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word 'no'."). But hear me out. Consider this quote:

> “data scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data for analysis.”

The dirty truth of data science is that most of the work is not actually data _science_ at all but data _engineering_.
Sure, there are some very clever people at Google etc who do true data science all day, every day. 
But for the rest of us, it's mostly pipelines all the way down.


Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Building pipelines is interesting stuff. But the industry needs to recognise that it's mostly doing software engineering not sexy science.

I was talking to a systems architect who bemoaned the fact that his data scientists didn't engage with the engineers nor the business stakeholders. 
They wanted to build LLMs. Why did they want to build LLMs? Well, haven't you read the news recently? They're everywhere! 
The fact that LLMs are a generative model and there was no business value in generating text was neither here nor there.
Just get the data engineers to deploy it and damn the torpedos.

Such attitudes were common during the mid-90s in software engineering. 
I have many happy memories of building things then justifying it to my boss later - with great success I hasten to add. 
It was the dotcom bubble and any one of those play things could have gone IPO, or so he thought. 
This is where data science is today in most large companies. Data scientists are working on pet projects with little shareholder value. 
And just as the software industry collapsed in 2001 so will the data science industry if things continue this way.
