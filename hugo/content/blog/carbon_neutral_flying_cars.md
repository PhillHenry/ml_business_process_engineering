Carbon-neutral flying cars are an admiral goal but are they realistic? Be honest with yourself about what you can reasonably achieve with AI.

### When a model flatters your ego

When you build a machine learning model, how do you measure how good it is? 
Oh sure, you're a maths whizz so you know exactly which algorithms to employ.
But it's surprisingly easy to become emotionally attached to a model and ignore warnings when it's cheating on you.

I once worked at a retail bank where we built models that classified customer transactions. 
Things were complicated by the categories being ambiguous.
For instance, was a parking fine to be classified as an "automobile", "municipal" or "discretionary" cost? 

The bank's own customers could not agree. 
They allocated their transactions equally to all three. Many payments were even self-classified as "gifts" - possibly somebody paying the fine of their adult child - who knows?
As a result, building a model that had laser accuracy was challenging to say the least.

To solve this problem, a data scientist on the team tested his model against his own personal transactions. 
Since he knew them intimately, he reasoned, he could evaluate his model accurately. 
And what do you know? The model was a huge success. 
However, he only had a hundred or so transactions and was ignoring the millions of other customers the bank had.

It was the devil's own work to persuade him that this was not reasonable, that the when his model was tested on millions of other customer's data, it did not perform quite as well. 

So, agree on what the criteria for success are *before* you start working on the model.

### Be Honest With Others

There are very few consultants out there telling their client that their idea for a machine learning pipeline is unrealistic. Why should they? 

I'm old enough to have been part of the DotCom boom in the 90s. 
During that time, consultants were telling their clients that, if they paid them lots of money, they would have a multi billion dollar IPO in no time. 
Nobody was making any money by being reasonable. 
That's how I successfully remained poor during the biggest boom in my lifetime.
